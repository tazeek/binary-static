                <h2>What is Margin?</h2>
                <p>Margin allows you to trade on leverage, giving you the same level of market exposure using much less capital.</p>

            <h2>What's a margin call and how do we apply it?</h2>
            <p>When your account equity is unable to cover the margin requirement, your account will be placed under margin call. This state does not affect your ability to open new positions.</p>

            <h2>What's a stop out level and how do we apply it?</h2>
            <p>If your account is placed under margin call for an extended period of time, it will reach the stop out level where it's unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to your pending orders being deleted, and open positions being forcibly closed (also known as forced liquidation).</p>
